# Milo

Package Manager for Modern iOS

# Why should i use this if i use other package managers
Well Milo includes some features other package managers do not include: 

* Tweak list sharing 
* Custom theming using an upcoming theming engine built specifically for Milo
* Setup backups for those times you want to upgrade without having to worry about reinstalling your tweaks 

Another thing is Milo is completely open source and anyone can contribute to it
